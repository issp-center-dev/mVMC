Program for the unrestricted Hartree-Fock approximation
=======================================================

In mVMC package, there is a program to calculate the initial values of
the pair orbital parameters :math:`f_{ij}` by using the unrestricted
Hartree-Fock (UHF) approximation (relation between Pfaffian Slater
determinant and single Slater determinant is explained in sec.
:ref:`PuffAndSlater`). It is noted that the target system of this program
is the itinerant electron system.

Overview
--------

In UHF approximation, two-body interaction terms are approximated as
one-body interaction terms by taking into account of the fluctuation,
:math:`\delta A \equiv A-\langle A \rangle`, up to the first order. As
an example, we consider the inter-site coulomb interactions

.. math::

   {\cal H}_V = \sum_{i,j}V_{ij} n_ {i}n_{j},

where we define :math:`i\equiv (i, \sigma)`,
:math:`j\equiv (j, \sigma')` for simplicity. Then, the interaction terms
can be approximated as

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   n_ {i}n_{j} &= (\langle n_{i} \rangle +\delta n_i) (\langle n_{j} \rangle +\delta n_j)
   - \left[ \langle c_{i}^{\dagger}c_j \rangle +\delta (c_{i}^{\dagger}c_j ) \right]
     \left[ \langle c_{j}^{\dagger}c_i \rangle +\delta (c_{j}^{\dagger}c_i )\right]
   \nonumber\\
   &\sim
   \langle n_{i} \rangle n_j+\langle n_{j} \rangle  n_i - \langle c_{i}^{\dagger}c_j \rangle  c_{j}^{\dagger}c_i
   - \langle c_{j}^{\dagger}c_i \rangle c_{i}^{\dagger}c_j 
   - \langle n_{i} \rangle \langle n_j \rangle +  \langle c_{j}^{\dagger}c_i \rangle \langle c_{i}^{\dagger}c_j \rangle.
   \end{aligned}

Also for other types of interaction, the problem can be attributed to a
one-body problem by using a similar approximation. Actual calculation is
performed iteratively until that self-consistent solution for the mean
values of the above observables are obtained.

Source code
~~~~~~~~~~~

A set of source codes are included in the directory
``src/ComplexUHF/src``.

How to compile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To compile source codes, move to the directory just below the main
directory of mVMC, and execute

.. code-block:: bash

    $ make mvmc

in a similar way as the compile of mVMC. After compiling, an executable
file ``UHF`` is generated in ``src/ComplexUHF/src``.

Input files
~~~~~~~~~~~

A file for assigning input files (namelist.def)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following files are needed to use the program of UHF. The format
of ``namelist.def`` is the same as defined in :ref:`InputFileList`.

-  ``ModPara``

-  ``LocSpin``

-  ``Trans``

-  ``CoulombIntra``

-  ``CoulombInter``

-  ``Hund``

-  ``PairHop``

-  ``Exchange``

-  ``Orbital`` / ``OrbitalAntiParallel``

-  ``OrbitalParallel``

-  ``OrbitalGeneral``

-  ``Initial``

Although the format of these files are the same as those for mVMC
basically, the following items are different:

-  Parameters assigned in ``ModPara`` file.

-  Addition of ``Initial`` file.

We explain details of the format of these files as follows.

Parameters assigned in ModPara file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The parameters needed in the program of UHF are as follows:

-  ``Nsite``

-  ``Ne``

-  ``Mix``

-  ``EPS``

-  ``IterationMax``

The parameters, ``Nsite`` and ``Ne``, are common as mVMC. The other
three parameters are specific to UHF:

-  ``Mix``
   
   Linear mixing is assigned by double-type. When mix=1, a new Green’s
   function is fully updated without using a old one.

-  ``EPS``
      
   A condition for convergence is assigned by int-type. When a
   residual error between a new Green’s function and a previous one is
   less than :math:`10^{-\verb|eps|}`, the iteration of calculation is
   stopped.

-  ``IterationMax``
      
   A maximum number of the loop is assigned by int-type.

If there are the other parameters for mVMC in this file , warning is
output to the standard output (the calculation is not stopped).

Initial file
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Initial values of Green’s function
:math:`G_{ij\sigma_1\sigma_2}\equiv \langle c_{i\sigma_1}^\dagger c_{j\sigma_2}\rangle`
are given. The format is the same as ``Trans`` file, and instead of
:math:`t_{ij\sigma_1\sigma_2}`, values of :math:`G_{ij\sigma_1\sigma_2}`
are described. Green’s function is set as zero if values are not given.

Usage
-----

Calculation of UHF is performed by the same way as mVMC, i.e., by
executing the command

::

    $ UHF namelist.def

The routine of the calculation is as follows.

#. Reading files

#. Construction of a Hamiltonian

#. Self-consistent calculation of Green’s function

#. Output of :math:`f_{ij}` and other files

Examples of output after calculation are as follows.
