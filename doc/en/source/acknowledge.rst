We would like to express our sincere gratitude to Mr. Daisuke Tahara for
providing us his code of variational Monte Carlo method. A part of mVMC
is based on his original code. We also acknowledge Dr. Hiroshi Shinaoka,
Dr. Youhei Yamaji, Dr. Moyuru Kurita, and Dr. Ryui Kaneko for their
cooperation on developing mVMC. We would also like to thank the support
from “Project for advancement of software usability in materials
science” by The Institute for Solid State Physics, The University of
Tokyo, for development of mVMC ver.0.1, ver. 0.2, and ver. 1.0.
